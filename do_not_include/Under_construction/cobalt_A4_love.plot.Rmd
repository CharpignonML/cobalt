This is a guide on how to use `love.plot` to its fullest potential, taking advantage of all of its many options and features. Other vignettes have described the basics of `love.plot`, but this guide goes more in depth. The help file for `love.plot` with `?love.plot` for the full documentation.

First, I'll describe the use of `love.plot` with binary and continuous treatments. Then, I'll go into faceted and aggregated plots in the context of multinomial treatments and clustered and multiply imputed data. I'll use the Lalonde data and `WeightIt` for all examples. `WeightIt` performs a variety of weighting methods, including propensity score weighting, which, for simplicity, will be the focus here.
